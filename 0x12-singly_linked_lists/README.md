#2. C - Singly linked lists

I learned about linked lists, when and why to use them and how to build and use them. 

##0-print_list.c
* Has a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
* Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
* Return: the number of nodes.
* If str is NULL, print [0] (nil).
